Manual for
BATTLESHIP GAME

/a TW3 and TW4 project in Codecool/

For the rules of the game see google or wikipedia.

---------------------
For this particular version:

This game has only multiplayer mode for two people.

1.--------------------
If you start the game, first you choose how many
ships you want to place.

2.--------------------
The first player put all the ships
(every time the seafield is printed out)

The size of the seafield is 10X10 like:

a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 a6 a7 a8 a9 a10 
b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6 b7 b8 b9 b10 
c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 c6 c7 c8 c9 c10 
d1 d2 d3 d4 d5 d6 d7 d8 d9 d10 
e1 e2 e3 e4 e5 e6 e7 e8 e9 e10 
f1 f2 f3 f4 f5 f6 f7 f8 f9 f10 
g1 g2 g3 g4 g5 g6 g7 g8 g9 g10 
h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 h6 h7 h8 h9 h10 
i1 i2 i3 i4 i5 i6 i7 i8 i9 i10 
j1 j2 j3 j4 j5 j6 j7 j8 j9 j10 

Use letters (rows) and numbers (columns) to enter the coordinates, e.g.: a1 a2

If you place 3 coordinate-long or longer ships, the first coord. means the starter coord., the second means the direction where the program completes the shipplacement.

The second direction meaning coordinate can be all the closest coordinates above, below and next to it.

The placed ships are indicated with OOs instead of the coordinates.

If you use wrong format or reserved place, you have to try again.

3.--------------------
After the screen is cleard, this happens to the second player, too.

4.--------------------
Then comes the battle phase.
The two players guess one by one.
Every time the guesses/strikes are printed out to help choosing.
If you miss target, it appears as grey xx, if you hit it, it appears as red @@.

5.--------------------
At the end of the game you get some statistics, the winner's strikes and a congratulation message.
